# Smart Water: Data Labeling with Active Learning And H2O.ai [doc](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/smart-water-data-labeling-with-active-learning-and-h2o-ai-c97349c0ba09)
In this project, we create a platform that users can upload the unlabeled data from local device, or AWS S3 bucket, and we use active learning and H2O.ai to smartly select which samples should be labeled first. This can significantly reduce data labeling costs and help users get high quality data for their machine learning models.
